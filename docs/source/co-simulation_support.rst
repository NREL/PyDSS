Pydss provides two pathways for configuring pydss for a co-simulation with external simulators. 
These interface help researchers cut lead time in setting up and configuring co-simulation setups to 
simulate cyber phsical interactions by coupling multiple domain scepific tools. Each interface has 
certain pros and cons detailed in the documentation pages.
